# Workshop Mod

4/29/22 This mod as of now will no longer be supported. Not sure if anyone uses it but the weekly updates always effect these files and its very difficult to keep updated every week. Its mainly the D_Talents.json file that causes issues. If I can figure out a better way to implement the mod without all the changes to this file I may update it again.

4/14/22 Updated for week 19 update.

4/8/22 Updated for week 18 update.

This mod replaces the gel packs in the workshop with consumable items that you can take into missions to help you get a head start. Contains weapons, buildings, and items for living in caves.

These items are a one time per mission use. If you dont use them in the mission you will return with the item. Once you use(Consume) the item it will be lost and the items will be added to your inventory.

Not compatible with other Mods.

Week 18 update added:
Jimk_Workshop_Items_Mod_V1_W18 _P.pak
Added Explosive arrows To this mod so you dont have to try and combine them. The explosive arrows are Completely new custom Items so it wont effect the Workshop Mod.
