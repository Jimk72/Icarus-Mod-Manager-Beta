# Icarus Mod Manager 2.0 

12/10/23 Ver 2.0.4
Minor bug fix with UI
Added sort to mods download page when clicking on column headers.

11/7/23 Beta Ver 2.0.0

First Beta release of new 2.0 system/file/folder setup.
I set this as a Beta as its a total rewrite of the backend folder structure/extracted mods system.
NOT COMPATIBLE with previous versions of IMM. Do not place in your old IMM folder as it will not pick up any mods.
Since the folder structure is all new Place in a new folder with a fresh start.
